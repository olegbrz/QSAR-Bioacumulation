# QSAR-Bioacumulation

This project is an implementation written in R of a scheme to predict whether a compound is

- Mainly stored within lipid tissues
- Has additional storage sites (e.g., proteins)
- Is metabolized/eliminated with a reduced bioconcentration

The approach is based on two validated QSAR (Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationship) trees, whose salient features are descriptor interpretability and simplicity.

The scheme is based on the following paper: [Investigating the mechanisms of bioconcentration through QSAR classification trees](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26760717/)
